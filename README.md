We know, A binary tree can be reconstructed when 
1. Inorder and Preorder traversal of tree is given
2. Inorder and Postorder traversal of tree is given.

Also , A binary tree can be reconstructed when 
1. Preorder traversal is given which contain information about the leaf node. 
2. Postorder traversal is given which contain information about the leaf node.

In this project, binary tree is reconstructed by the inorder traversal of tree , with the extra information of level of 
each node and direction of a node with respect to its parent.
